description: Semantic color tokens that adapt to the selected color palette.

Semantic color tokens are purpose-based color definitions. They adapt dynamically based on the selected color palette (colorPalette).

## colorPalette

Each color (mori, umi, blue, red, yellow, gray) follows the same structure. When you set colorPalette, the corresponding color tokens are applied.
